==> Using Pygame. A collection of fun powerful pyhon modules that manages graphics anniimation, and even sound.
Project folder --> Alien Invation Folder --> install pygame and build.

Plan: 
--> The player will control a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the game.
--> The player can move ship to right or left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using space bar
--> When game starts a fleet of alien will fill the sky above the top
--> Shoot doen aliens before they reach player or bottom of screen

STEP1:
Navigate to folder and install pygame:
######
python -m pip install -user pygame 	or 	pip install pygame
#####

STEP 2:
Each time we introuduce a new functionality into the game we would typically create new settings. Instead of adding the settings into our code its best to create a seperate module
called settings.py, that contains a class called Settings:
NB: We can have various files that use the same settings module.

STEP 3:
Import settings from Settings, and instantiate the new Settings class

STEP 4: 
Add the ship to your game by loading an Image. convert your jpeg to bitmap.

STEP 5:
We create a ship module that will have the class Ship, this will manage the behaviour of the player.

STEP 6:
Refactor code:
